# About Me
I am a full-time research scientist at [Appier](https://www.appier.com/en/) AI Research Team, where I work with advisors Prof. [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php). Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), where I was advised by Prof. [Hsin-Hsi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CRth4q4AAAAJ&hl=en), leader of the [NLPLab](https://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/). I am also a licensed medical doctor, having obtained my Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from NTU.

# Research Interests
I am broadly interested in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and their relationships with human cognition.
Recently, I am especially intrigued by the mysteries behind large language models (LLMs), and find the works that discover their surprising properties most exciting.
Some of my favorite works:
- [Physics of Language Models](https://physics.allen-zhu.com/) (Allen-Zhu et al., 2024)
- [Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12837) (Min et al., 2022)
- [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) (Brown et al., 2020)

In line with the above interests, my long-term research goal is to uncover how these models store, retrieve, and manipulate knowledge, as well as how they perform reasoning.
I believe that this research direction would deepen our understanding of the nature of intelligence.

# My Favorite Quote
> Research is the search for reality. It is a wonderful search. It keeps us humble. Authentic humility is striving to see things how they are, rather than how we want them to be. - by Kevin Gimpel in his [advice](https://home.ttic.edu/~kgimpel/etc/phd-advice.pdf) on being a happier researcher
