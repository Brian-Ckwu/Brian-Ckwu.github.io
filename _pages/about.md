# About Me
I am a full-time research scientist at [Appier](https://www.appier.com/en/) AI Research Team, where I work with advisors Prof. [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php). Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), where I was advised by Prof. [Hsin-Hsi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CRth4q4AAAAJ&hl=en), leader of the [NLPLab](https://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/). I am also a licensed medical doctor, having obtained my Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from NTU.

# Research Interests
I am broadly interested in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (ML), and their relationships with human cognition. I am especially intrigued by the mysteries behind large foundation models: Why do they work? How do we understand them better? What's their similarity and difference compared to human cognitive abilities? In pursuit of these questions, my long-term research goal is to explore how computational models store, retrieve, and manipulate knowledge, as well as how they perform reasoning. I believe that this research direction would deepen our understanding of the nature of intelligence.

# My Favorite Quote
> Research is the search for reality. It is a wonderful search. It keeps us humble. Authentic humility is striving to see things how they are, rather than how we want them to be. - by Kevin Gimpel in his [advice](https://home.ttic.edu/~kgimpel/etc/phd-advice.pdf) on being a happier researcher
