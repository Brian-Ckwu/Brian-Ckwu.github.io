## Short Bio
I am a full-time research scientist at [Appier](https://www.appier.com/en/) AI Research Team, where I work with advisors Prof. [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php). Previously, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), where I was advised by Prof. [Hsin-Hsi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CRth4q4AAAAJ&hl=en), leader of the [NLPLab](https://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/). I am also a licensed medical doctor, having obtained my Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from NTU.

## Research Interests
My research is guided by a simple philosophy: all human beings deserve to flourish and realize their full potential, and artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help achieve this ideal.
Therefore, I believe that AI research should not only be innovative, but also purposefully aligned with benefits to humanity.
My research interests center on two tightly coupled directions:

1. Capability: overcoming limitations of current AI systems (e.g., continual learning, specifically [loss of plasticity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07711-7) and [catastrophic forgetting](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(99)01294-2) in deep learning) so that future AIs can address the complex challenges humans will face; and
2. Safety, reliability, and robustness: ensuring that increasingly powerful systems behave in aligned, trustworthy, and dependable ways across diverse scenarios.

I view advanced AI as a transformative technology with both tremendous upside and existential risk, making it the most important technical problem of our time.
Progress therefore requires advancing capability and safety in tandem, with careful preparation for rapidly increasing capabilities, as novel breakthroughs often introduce new risks.
For example, progress in continual learning may open up new attack surfaces for injecting malicious content into AI systems.

In my past research, I have studied various topics related to language models (LMs), such as [benchmarking continual learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08747), [uncertainty awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01332), and the [robustness issues](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-industry.91/).
The full list of my publications is available on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hc_e7rsAAAAJ&hl=en).

## My Favorite Quote
> Research is the search for reality. It is a wonderful search. It keeps us humble. Authentic humility is striving to see things how they are, rather than how we want them to be. - by Kevin Gimpel in his [advice](https://home.ttic.edu/~kgimpel/etc/phd-advice.pdf) on being a happier researcher
